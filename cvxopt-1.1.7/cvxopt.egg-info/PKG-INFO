Description: 
        CVXOPT is a free software package for convex optimization based on the 
        Python programming language. It can be used with the interactive Python 
        interpreter, on the command line by executing Python scripts, or 
        integrated in other software via Python extension modules. Its main 
        purpose is to make the development of software for convex optimization 
        applications straightforward by building on Python's extensive standard 
        library and on the strengths of Python as a high-level programming 
        language.
